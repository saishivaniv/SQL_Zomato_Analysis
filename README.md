# SQL_Zomato_Analysis

An analysis of Zomato, a popular food delivery platform, using SQL queries. The analysis involved working with a database containing tables for
gold user signups, user information, sales, and product details.

SQL queries used in the project include:

- Counting the number of gold user signups. 
- Calculating the average price of products.   
- Determining the total sales amount.    
- Calculating the total amount spent by each customer on Zomato.          
- Counting the number of days each customer visited Zomato.        
- Identifying the first product purchased by each customer.        
- Determining the most purchased item on the menu and how many times it was purchased by all customers.                               
- Identifying the most popular item for each customer.                    
- Determining the item purchased first by the customer after they became a member.          
- Identifying the item purchased just before the customer became a member.           
- Calculating the total orders and amount spent for each member before they became a member.             


These queries were used to extract meaningful insights from the Zomato database and provide valuable information about user behavior, popular 
items, and member-related analysis.
